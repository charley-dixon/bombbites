        <h4>Teriyaki Tofu Bao Buns</h4>

        <p>These buns were an absolute home run. This is easily one of my favorite dishes I have ever made, and quite an enjoyable process as well! The light and pillowy buns came together with a few simple pantry ingredients. In this post I will walk you through the process of making the buns from scratch.</p>

        <h4>Falafel</h4>

        <p>I have not made falafel very often because it seemed to turn out dense and dry, but I discovered a technique that I had not yet tried that I was eager to it test out! This technique includes adding whipped egg whites to the batter to produce a lighter, airy texture. Although the batter seemed wetter than we expected, we were thrilled with the outcome. These little falafels were light, crisp and heavenly. Join me this week in a Mediterranean feast!</p>

        <h4>Green Chile Guacamole</h4>
        <img src="./media/guac.jpeg" alt="Homemade guacamole in a solid black mortar.">
        <p>This dip is fully loaded, so if you are a guac purist, this is not the recipe for you. But if you’re looking to kick it up a notch with your guac, I think you’ll want to give this one a spin. The base of the recipe is my go to guac, but I kicked it up a notch this time with some extra flair. The holiday weekend is just around the corner and this is could be your perfect pool party pleaser!</p>

        <h4>Detroit Style Pizza</h4>

        <p>As my parting goodbye to the children’s museum, I made 18 pizzas for the staff to thank them for crushing this crazy year. A coworker asked if I could teach her how to make pizza before I left so we made everything from scratch. This is my grandpas dough recipe and my uncles sauce recipe.</p>

        <h4>Kale Caesar Salad</h4>
        <img src="./media/salad.jpeg" alt="Birds eye view of caesar salad with an avocado flower in the center.">
        <p>To be totally transparent, I am not the type of chef who measures anything. That being said, the dressing recipe is a rough estimate of what I typically do. As always, adjust recipes based on your own taste buds. This is my go to salad dressing (and my most requested among friends) so please enjoy!</p>
